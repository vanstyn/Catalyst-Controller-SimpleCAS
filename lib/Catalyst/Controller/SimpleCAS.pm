=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Controller::SimpleCAS - General-purpose content-addressed storage (CAS) for Catalyst

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Catalyst::Controller::SimpleCAS;
 ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This controller provides a simple content-addressed storage backend for Catalyst applications. 

This module was originally developed within L<RapidApp> before being extracted into its own module.
This is a preliminary version which matches what was in RapidApp (and is still rough around the
edges, poor test coverage, incomplete docs, etc). Subsequent versions will be polished better, as 
well as have API changes and improvements... 

Other than for RapidApp itself, it is not suggested that this module be used yet in production...


=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 store_class

Object class to use for the Store backend. Defaults to 
C<Catalyst::Controller::SimpleCAS::Store::File>

=head2 store_path

Directory/path to be used by the Store. Defaults to C<cas_store> within the Catalyst home directory.

=head2 Store

Actual object instance of the Store. By default this object is built using the C<store_class> (by 
calling C<new()>) with the C<store_path> supplied to the constructor.

=head2 _json_view_name

Name of an optional Catalyst View to forward to to render JSON responses, with the pre-encoded 
JSON set in the stash key 'jsonData'. If not set, the encoded JSON is simply set in response body 
with the Content-Type set to C<application/json>.

If the view name C<RapidApp::View> is loaded (which is the case when L<RapidApp> is loaded),
it is used as the default. This is needed to support special round-trip encodings for 
"Insert Image" and other ExtJS-based upload interfaces.


=head1 PUBLIC ACTIONS

=head2 upload_content

Upload new content to the CAS and return the sha1 checksum in the body to be able to access it later. 
Because of the CAS design, the system automatically deduplicates, and will only ever store
a single copy of a given unique piece of content in the Store. 

=head2 fetch_content

Fetch existing content from the CAS according its sha1 checksum. 

Example:

  GET /simplecas/fetch_content/fdb379f7e9c8d0a1fcd3b5ee4233d88c5a4a023e

The system attempts to identify the content type and sets the MIME type accordingly. Additionally,
an optional filename argument can be also be supplied in the URL

  GET /simplecas/fetch_content/fdb379f7e9c8d0a1fcd3b5ee4233d88c5a4a023e/somefile.txt

The main reason this is supported is simply for more human-friendly URLs. The name is not stored
or validated in any way. If supplied, this does nothing other than being used to set the 
content-disposition:

  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="somefile.txt"

When there is no filename second arg supplied, the content-disposition is set like this:

  Content-Disposition: inline;filename="fdb379f7e9c8d0a1fcd3b5ee4233d88c5a4a023e"

=head2 upload_file

Works like C<upload_content>, but returns a JSON packet with additional metadata/information in
the body.

=head2 upload_image

Works like C<upload_file>, but with some image-specific functionality, including client-supplied
max width and height values supplied as the first and second args, respectively. For example,
a POST I<upload> with I<Filedata> containing an image, and declared max size of 800x600 uses a
URL like:

  POST /simplecas/upload_image/800/600

When the image is larger than the max width or height, I<if> the optional dependency 
L<Image::Resize> is available (which requires L<GD>) it is used to resize the image, preserving
height/width proportions accordingly, and the new, resized image is what is stored in the CAS.
Otherwise, the image is not resized, but resized dimensions are returned in the JSON packet
so the client can generate an C<img> tag for display.

Originally, L<Image::Resize> was a standard dependency, but this can be a PITA to get installed
with all of the dependencies of L<GD>.

=head2 upload_echo_base64

This does nothing but accept a standard POST/Filedata upload and return it as base64 in a JSON
packet within the JSON/object key C<echo_content>.

=head2 base

This is the base action of the Catalyst Chain behind this asset controller. So
far it still is a fixed position, but we will allow in a later version to set
the Chained base to any other action via configuration.

You could override specific URLs inside the SimpleCAS with own controllers,
you just chain to this base controller, but we would strongly advice to put
those outside functionalities next to this controller.
